        <h1>Hello JavaScript</h1>
        <h2>Where to put JavaScript in html</h2>
        <p>
            Best practice is to insert JavaScript code to the end of the body
            section as browser execute the html page top to bottom. So
            javascript should ideally run when browser has read all the dom
            elements.
            <br /><br />
            Third party codes should be placed in the head section.
            <br /><br />
            You may either write complete script in the html file itself or
            write script in external file and just source it by its location.
            <br />
            <br />
            Open console to see effect.
